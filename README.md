## Bugs

1. I had to change the margins for smaller screens. 
2. When I deployed my site on GitHub the logo and map wasn't responsive. I had to change the file paths by removing ./ from the start. 
3. My form wouldn't stay to the left so I had to fix my margins and add float: left.
4. The footer wouldn't stay at the bottom of my screen. I fixed this by adding bottom:0.
